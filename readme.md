# Ubos sa Dagat: The Under Sea

## **About the Project**

**Ubos sa Dagat: The Under Sea** is a net art project by Khokhoi (Mary Alinney Villacastin), weaving together archival imagery from the **Folger Shakespeare Library** and **underwater photography by Basorerong Parat**.

The deeper the dive, the greater the pressure, revealing the **wreckage of the imperial archive** alongside pulsating glimmers of decolonial futures. *Ubos sa Dagat: The Under Sea* envisions **freediving as a techno-ecology**, a native framework for accessing global timelines through islander memory.

The web-based experience mimics the movement of diving through **a vertical scroll-driven interaction**:
