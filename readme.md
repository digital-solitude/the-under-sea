# Ubos sa Dagat: The Under Sea

## **About the Project**

**Ubos sa Dagat: The Under Sea** is a net art project by Khokhoi (Mary Alinney Villacastin), weaving together archival imagery from the **Folger Shakespeare Library** and **underwater photography by Basorerong Parat**. Shot from the perspective of an enchanted freediver guided by the whispering spirit of a marine sanctuary guardian, this project invites a **re-Indigenization of the colonial archive**.

As the freediver descends, animated references and historical echoes emerge, dissolve, and liquefy in submerged memory. The deeper the dive, the greater the pressure, revealing the **wreckage of the imperial archive** alongside pulsating glimmers of decolonial futures. *Ubos sa Dagat: The Under Sea* envisions **freediving as a techno-ecology**, a native framework for accessing global timelines through islander memory.

The web-based experience mimics the movement of diving through **a vertical scroll-driven interaction**.

The project uses https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/
